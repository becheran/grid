Data structure grid for rust. Provide a two dimensional data structure for rust that is easy to use and fast.
Most of the functionality provided by the [std::vec::Vec](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) type for one dimensional vectors
is implemented for two dimensions in this crate.

To use *grid* with *no_std* import the library such as:

``` toml
grid = { version = "*", default-features = false }
```
